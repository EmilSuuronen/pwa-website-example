    <p class="text-intro">Rani Ki Vav (lit. 'The Queen's Stepwell')
        is a stepwell situated in the town of Patan in Gujarat, India.
        It is located on the banks of the Saraswati River.
        Its construction is attributed to Udayamati, the spouse of the 11th-century Chaulukya king Bhima I.
        Silted over, it was rediscovered in the 1940s and restored in the 1980s by the Archaeological Survey of India.
        It has been listed as one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India since 2014.
        This stepwell is designed as an inverted temple highlighting the sanctity of water.
        It is divided into seven levels of stairs with sculptural panels.
        These panels have more than 500 principal sculptures and over 1000 minor ones combining religious, secular,
        and symbolic imagery.

    <p class="text-intro">Rani ki vav was constructed during the rule of the Chaulukya dynasty.
        It is located on the banks of Saraswati river. Prabandha-Chintamani, composed by the Jain monk
        Merutunga in 1304, mentions: "Udayamati, the daughter of Naravaraha Khengara, built this novel stepwell
        at Shripattana (Patan) surpassing the glory of the Sahasralinga Tank". According to it, the stepwell
        was commissioned in 1063 and was completed after 20 years. It is generally assumed that it was built in
        the memory of Bhima I (1022 – 1064) by his queen Udayamati and probably completed by
        Udayamati and Karna after his death but whether she was a widow when she commissioned it is disputed.
        Commissariat puts the date of construction to 1032 based on the architectural similarity to Vimalavasahi
        temple on Mount Abu built in the same year.
